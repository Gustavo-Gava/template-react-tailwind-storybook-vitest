# Structure of features components

## About

Features are a combination of components, hooks, and contexts that are used to implement a specific functionality in the application. Each feature should be self-contained and should not depend on other features.

## Structure of a feature

```bash
|-features
| |-feature-name
| | |-components
| | |-hooks
| | |-pages
| | |-utils
```
